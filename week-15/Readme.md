## Why Containerisation?

1. Everyone has different Operating systems
2. Steps to run a project can vary based on OS
3. Extremely harder to keep track of dependencies as project grows
4. What if there was a way to describe your projects configuration in a single file?
5. What if that could be run in an isolated environment
6. Makes Local setup of OS projects a breeze
7. Makes installing auxiliary services/DBs easy
